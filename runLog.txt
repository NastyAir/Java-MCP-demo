RESPONSE: <think>
Okay, let's see. The user wants to send a welcome email to Bob upon his joining the company. First, I need to get Bob's information to personalize the email. So I called the getPerson function with Bob's name. The response provided his details: phone, email, company, and title.

Next, I used the sentEmail function to send the email. The body was tailored to mention his new position at Microsoft and look forward to his contributions. The email address was bob@example.com, which matches the one retrieved from getPerson. The subject was "欢迎加入公司" which is the Chinese version of "Welcome to the Company".

The tool response indicated that the email was sent successfully. Now, I need to confirm that everything went through. The user might want a final confirmation that Bob received the email. Since the status is "sent", I should inform them that the email was successfully sent to Bob. Also, maybe mention the details like the subject and body to show personalization. But since the user didn't ask for a follow-up, just a confirmation, I'll keep it concise.

邮件已成功发送至Bob（邮箱：bob@example.com），主题为"欢迎加入公司"，内容为："欢迎加入Microsoft！您被任命为CFO，期待您的贡献。" 您可随时查阅邮件状态。
